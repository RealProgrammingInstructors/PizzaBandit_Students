# PizzaBandit_Students

Pizza Bandit (Java Processing) features a raccoon named Reggie who is trying to get all of the pizza spread around Pizzaville before animal control gets a hold of him with their robotic cages. Join Reggie and others such as Cheeky Pete and Suzie Coo as they navigate the streets filled with Pizza!

This course introduces sprites as part of the base game, with basic animation demonstrated for multiple objects in the game. Students explore creating a classic arcade game while introducing their own unique ideas through customization. Explore Java Programming from the ground up with the help of Java Processing.

Students in Java Pizza Bandit will be introduced to variables, objects, classes, loops, and key events to create effects of animation. Utilize the full power of Processing with Java in this beginner level course!

# Learning Goals

Learning goals should be understood by students at the end of the classes

## General Code Skill
* Variables (types, name, value assignment, global and local scope)
* Images and Animations (how loading images work using file path in code, creating animation effects with multiple sprites)
* Functions (return types, parameters, arguments)
* Arrays (creating array, retrieving array members, etc.)
* Loops (for, while, foreach)
* Creating new objects
* Code separation (increase readability with strategic files)
* Object Pooling
* Conditional Logic (if-statements, booleans, etc.)
* Keyboard Inputs
* Recognizing and Solving Problems, Refactoring, Pattern Recognition
* Arithmetic with Java Syntax (+,-,/,*, LHS, RHS etc.)

## Objected Oriented Programming
* Class Structure (constructor, methods, etc.)
* Creating new objects
* Dot notation (invoking object properties and functions)

## Math
* Rectangle AABB Collision
* Basic Math Arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
* Pseudo-Random Number Generation
* Cage-to-Player Distance Calculation
* Cartesian Coordinate System (x,y coordinates on screen window)
  
# Course Outline
This course is broken down into 18 lessons. Each lesson should be completed in the span of one class, however, depending on student pacing,
a lesson can be two weeks long. Students who finish early can customize the game however theyâ€™d like with the instructor's help.
